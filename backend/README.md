## Introduction

**DTC-OPTIMUS** is a comprehensive software solution designed to automate various aspects of bus scheduling and route management for the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC). The Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System will utilize algorithms, data analytics, and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to automate various aspects of bus scheduling and route management. The project aims to develop a comprehensive software solution to streamline bus scheduling, optimize resource utilization, and improve route planning.

Efficient bus scheduling and route planning are essential for the smooth operation of public bus transport services. Currently, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) relies on manual methods for scheduling and planning, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. To improve operational efficiency, reduce errors, and enhance service reliability, DTC needs an automated software solution capable of handling both linked and unlinked duty scheduling, facilitate route management by mapping all existing routes and highlighting overlaps with proposed new routes.
